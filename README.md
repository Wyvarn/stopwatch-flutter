# Stopwatch

A simple stopwatch made in Flutter.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view the [documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Prerequisites

You will need [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) setup and installed on your development machine and a working knowledge of [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/)

All you will need for this project is the flutter sdk configured and ready. Once you have that setup, simply run (once a device is attached):

```bash
$ flutter run
```
> This will run the application in debug mode on the connected device.

That is it, Enjoy!
